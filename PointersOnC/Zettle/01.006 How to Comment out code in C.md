# 01.006 How to Comment out code in C
---

to comment out code it is not a good idea to use the normal way of commenting code with `*/` which is used for normal comments 
the reason is because if you have any other comments in the block of code it will simply not work
its better to do something like this with #if and #endif
```
#if 0
	statements(aka.your.code)
#endif
```
