# 01.014 while loop and eof example
---

the author mentions that a [[while loop]] he made it to read and and discards the remaining characters to prevent them from being interpreted  as the first line of data 
`(char = getchar()) != EOF && ch != '\n'`
the *getchar* read a  single character from the standard input and returns a value  
the value that is returned to *getchar* is assigned to the **ch** varible 
and if there are no more characters
