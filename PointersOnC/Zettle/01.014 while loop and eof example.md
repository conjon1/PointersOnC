# 01.014 while loop and eof example
---

the author mentions that a [[while loop]] he made it to read and and discards the remaining characters to prevent them from being interpreted  as the first line of data 
`while( (char = getchar()) != EOF && ch != '\n')`
the *getchar* read a  single character from the standard input and returns a value  
the value that is returned to *getchar* is assigned to the **ch** varible and is compared to EOF
the parentheses enclosed in the assignment ensure that is done before the comparing happens. Otherwise ch is compared to a newline, again, the loop stops if they are found to be equal 
this means that the loop discards the remaining characters on the current input lined
