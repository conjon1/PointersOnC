# 01.012 scanf function
---
opposite of the [[01.010 printf function]]
in [[<stdio.h>]] 

01.014 
scanf only reads as far as if had to when converting input values  
so that means that the remainder of the line that contained the last value will still be "out there" waiting to be read 
it could contain just the end of the new line or other characters 

the author mentions that a [[while loop]] he made it to read and and discards the remaining characters to prevent them from being interpreted  as the first line of data 
`(char = getchar()) != EOF && ch != '\n'`
