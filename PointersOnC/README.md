## How it is the notes are organized 

I highly recommend to use obsidian for this as it is the software along with nvim to make these notes (you dont need nvim)

## Zettlekasten (kinda)
how I write notes is a weird version of the zettlekasten method, mainly relying on searching for key words in obsidian or in vim when i need to go look at a note for a certain problem. This is especially helpful with nvim within my environment while i am coding. 
## The Format 
The format is as follows 
`00.000` = chapterNumber.pageNumber 
The tag section is for related notes or subjects, this helps with seeing how things and link together

The status section is for if the notes are #fleeting #complete-thought #quick 
Fleeting just really means that it is a passing thought of mine and can disregard unless you like my thoughts then go ahead and read them.
complete is a well thought out note with refrences and ideas
quick is the equivalent of a jot
