#include <stdio.h>



// write program that reads characters from the input and writes them to output.
// it should compute the the checksum and write it out after the characters .
// The checksum is computed in a signed char varible that is initiallized to -1.
// as each character is read from the input it id added to the checksum .
// any overflow from the checksum should be ignored
// when all of the chararcters have been written the checksum is then written as a decimal interger which may be negitive.
// be sure to follow the checksum with a new line
// on ASCII it should be
// Hello world!
// 102
